# Introducing Myself

Hello World, I am **Veekshith Kodithyala** :3.

I live in India and I plan to go abroad for my studies.

As of today, I am a in Junior year of high school enrolled in the IBDP course (May 2027). I chose the IBDP because it offeres me more opportunities to go abroad for studies and also, I value the research based learning method which is different from the method of learning problem solving in the shortest possible time in the cirriculum of the CBSE, ICSE and other Indian boards.
I intend to study BSc. Physics and then become a researcher or work in some niche engineering fields.

I started to code since I was 8 years old. My first experience with coding was when my tutor said that people hack computers by coding. I started researching on this topic and little by little grew interested in it. Programming has changed my life, I wouldn't have been like this if it wasn't for coding.

My interests are reading, coding, philosophy, psychology, history, geology, mathematics, science (specifically physics and biology). I do not play any sports, I consider myself to be more of a "nerd".

I am an INTP Ni-Ti-Fi-Se 4w5 Sx/Sp 541 ILI Normalizing/Harmonizing Melancholic, Phlegmatic, Lawful-Neutral OCEAN

I created this blog so I can keep track of my projects, problems and my ideas.

I also want to be a femboy (this just adds to the stereotype that CS men are feminine, doesn't it lol?), and I think I can pull it off if I set my mind to it but unfortunately I won't have the chance to until I get out of this country TwT

This is the end of my introduction, thanks for reading :33
